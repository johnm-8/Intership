# Intership

Hi, I hope you are having a blessed day. Here is the project that I was able to develop. Now, my head is not thinking at the moment, so my idea is blank. I just wanted to add on to the idea for everyone that presented their idea to the whole classroom. 

Here is me drawing the template *I mostly perfer drawing it out because it makes me brainstorm different ideas, and if I don't like the idea then I put DON'T LIKE IDEA* 

Now, the template show a BMCC Chatbot.
--------------------------------------

In Step 1) There the BMCC Mascot Logo called "Manny" (Credit:Ye) and under it there the name BMCC Chatbot or "Talk to our Mascot AI called "Manny" "

In Step 2) Once, you click "Manny" it will redirect you to Login and Password (Credit: Eslem, Mark, Methsara, and Andy). The login could be be your BMCC email and your password should be your EMPLID number. 

In Step 3) When you log in, then you will see "AI Manny" and in bottom of that you will see "Ask any questions about INC" and it will have a bubble animation in the bottom. Bottom of that you will see BMCC Mascot Logo. 

In Step 4) Once, you type the questions it will transition to Step 4, when the AIManny and User is going to be talking about INC grades and setup anything that the students wants to know about INC grades.

Template for IPhone 
-------------------

Is the same thing as pervious, the only difference I want to add is the "+" sign in, this is insipiration from ChatGPT, Bard, Claude, and many other apps. This is where students could add a doc, pdf, csv, etc.
