# Intership

Hi, I hope you are having a blessed day. Here is the project that I was able to develop. Now, my head is not thinking at the moment, so my idea is blank. I just wanted to add on to the idea for everyone that presented their idea to the whole classroom. 

Here is me drawing the template *I mostly perfer this becuase it makes me brainstorm different ideas, and if I don't like the idea then I put DON'T LIKE IDEA*
